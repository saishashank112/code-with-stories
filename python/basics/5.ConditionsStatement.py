# 5. Conditional Statements (if/else)
# Definition: These control what code runs based on conditions.

# Scenario: A banking app checks if the balance is enough before withdrawing:

balance = 1000  # Current balance
amount = 500  # Amount to withdraw
if balance >= amount:
    print("Withdrawal successful")
else:
    print("Insufficient funds")
